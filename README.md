Research code for the paper "Comparison of BERT Models in Predicting PTSD from Reddit Posts".

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health condition that occurs in individuals who have experienced a traumatic event such as violence, accidents, or sexual assault. Traditionally, it has been diagnosed by mental health professionals, but by analyzing large amounts of natural language data, it may be possible to improve automated detection or diagnosis methods. In this study, Reddit, chosen for its promotion of anonymity and genuine expression, serves as the data source. For natural language feature extraction, three BERT variants are employed: MentalBERT, PsychBERT, and ClinicalBERT. The set of vector embeddings generated by each model is used as the feature set for a binary K-Nearest-Neighbor classifier. The results show that PsychBERTâ€™s embeddings enabled the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 97.7%. MentalBERT and ClinicalBERT achieved accuracies of 95.0% and 85.6% respectively. These results suggest that state-of-the-art performance is possible using BERT and KNN classifiers on Reddit PTSD data.
